# Mission-to-Mars
Mars website called Mission to Mars that is updated with the latest information on the red planet
## Overview
In this repository, I created a html that contains a variety of information about the planet Mars. The html scrapes from multiple websites and places them all into the singular html file. For this project I used splinter, BeautifulSoup, pandas, flask, MongoDB and Webdriver.
## Results
The html file includes the following
- The latest information on mars was gathered from [Nasa Mars News Site](https://redplanetscience.com)
- A [featured image](https://spaceimages-mars.com)
- A table of [Mars Facts](https://galaxyfacts-mars.com)
- Four images of the [Mars Hemispheres](https://astrogeology.usgs.gov/search/results?q=hemisphere+enhanced&k1=target&v1=Mars)

All of this information was scraped from each indvidual website and put into the index.html file of this repository.

**The first step was to collect the lastest news, a featured image and mars facts and put them into the html file.**
